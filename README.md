# Notflix

Notflix is a web service API

The API provides endpoints for user connection, movie browsing, and recommendation functionalities. It allows users to create accounts, log in, browse categories and movies, and receive personalized movie recommendation.

## How to run

create a config folder inside NodeJS with a file named .env.local:
it should have that info:

```
CONNECTION_STRING='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/Notflix'
PORT=3000
HOST=host.docker.internal
```

To run both servers using docker compose:

```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

It might takes some time for the docker to load and run (wait around 30 seconds before running commands)
