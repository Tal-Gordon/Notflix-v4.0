# Notflix

Notflix is a movie streaming website and Android app, where you can search for movies by name, actors, directors and movie categories.
It also has a recommendation system based on other users with shared movies.

(This is totally not a Netflix ripoff)

The project's wiki: https://github.com/Tal-Gordon/Notflix-v4.0/wiki

It has information on how to run the app, how to gain admin permissions, how to add and change categories and movies, and how to navigate the Android app and website.
